# Comment Style Lint

A custom lint rule for Dart/Flutter projects that enforces consistent comment formatting by requiring a space after comment symbols (`//`). This helps maintain a clean and readable codebase by ensuring consistent comment style across your project.

## Features

- üîç Enforces a space after single-line comment symbols (`//`)
- üõ†Ô∏è Provides automatic fixes for comment formatting
- ‚ö° Integrates with Dart's analyzer and custom_lint
- üìù Supports both Dart and Flutter projects
- üîÑ Real-time linting in your IDE

## Getting started

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  comment_style_lint:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/witchcraft2001/comment_style_lint.git
```

Create or update the `analysis_options.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint

custom_lint:
  rules:
    - comment_space_required: true
```

## Usage

The linter will automatically check your code for proper comment formatting. Here are some examples:

```dart
// This is correct
//This is incorrect

// This is also correct
//This is also incorrect

// This is a long comment that explains
// something important about the code
//This is incorrect because it has no space
```

When the linter finds incorrect formatting, it will:
1. Show a warning message with a red squiggly line
2. Provide a quick fix option to add the missing space
3. Allow you to apply the fix automatically with a single click

### IDE Integration

The linter works seamlessly with:
- VS Code
- Android Studio
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Additional information

### How it works

The package uses the `custom_lint` framework to create a custom lint rule that:
1. Scans your Dart code for comments
2. Checks if there's a space after the `//` symbol
3. Reports issues when spaces are missing
4. Provides automatic fixes
